# A Machine Learning Handbook

A student-sourced Machine Learning Handbook for ICS5110.  Instructions for submission:

1. Clone the repository
2. Edit the `ics5110_ml_handbook.tex` file
   * Find the `TODO` labels inside this file (3 instances), change/add your stuff accordingly
3. Add your term file and bibliography to the `terms` directory.  This should have 
the form of `term_initials.tex` where `term` is your actual term and 
`initials` are your initials (e.g. `overfitting_jpe.tex`).  Also add your
bibliography (i.e. `term_initials.bib`) there.
4. Create a pull request ([read here](https://help.github.com/articles/creating-a-pull-request/) for more details)

**Submit as early as possible as you are bound to get feedback on your work (no need to wait for the deadline, everyone is doing something different anyway).**
